# Exploring Policy as Code for Cloud Infrastructure

*Note: This was to be a joint presentation with the amazingly wonderful [Rosemary Wang](https://joatmon08.github.io/). However, the morning of the workshop, I woke up ill, and Rosemary presented this solo.*

## Abstract 

How do you check for security requirements while you build your cloud infrastructure? In this workshop, we'll walk through how to use policy as code to deliver and release an immutable machine image with security in mind. Learn to use static analysis to check provisioning scripts for security requirements. Then, you'll construct a secure image with Packer. Finally, you'll create a test server with Terraform and dynamically analyze the server runtime for vulnerabilities. Bring your own machine and make sure you install prerequisites listed at [https://github.com/tracypholmes/policy-as-code-workshop](https://github.com/tracypholmes/policy-as-code-workshop/blob/main/README.md).

# Continuously Deliver your Blog as Code with Terraform

*Note: This talk was given at ATO '21 first. Then 10 days later at ADDO '21. The only difference is a slide. This talk was a STRONG reminder of why I don't do live demos - the API I was using wasn't/isn't fully working, and I couldn't get this to work, but this continues to be a passion project and my goal is to get it working at some point. That said, I DID accomplish my goal of building a provider...so I am pretty proud of that.*

## Abstract

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code tool for declaratively building and maintaining complex infrastructures on one or more cloud providers/services. But Terraform also supports over 90 non-infrastructure providers! My blog publication workflow is really manual, as I have to not only write the blog post, I have to also generate it, review it, and stage for publication! So, I built a Dev.to Provider for Terraform to automate it. In this talk, I will dive into how I built it, challenges into making it work, and how I used other automation to write, publish, and socialize it!

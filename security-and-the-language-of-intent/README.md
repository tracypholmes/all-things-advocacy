# Security and the Language of Intent

## Abstract

Infrastructure as code empowers developers and operators to scale systems and maximize availability, but what about improving security? The language of security can be difficult to remember and implement under delivery pressure. In this talk, Tracy will discuss why the language of security for infrastructure is often lost in translation and how policy as code can help. By using tools such as HashiCorp Sentinel, you can use policy as code to communicate and translate the security intentions you want and expect in your infrastructure.

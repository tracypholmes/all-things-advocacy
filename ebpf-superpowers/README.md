# eBPF Superpowers

## Abstract

eBPF has been called “Superpowers for Linux”, and in this talk Tracy discusses why it’s a foundational technology for a new generation of cloud native networking, security and observability tools. If you have heard the term, but don't know what it is and how to use it then this talk is for you? The questions this talk answers include:

1. What is eBPF?
1. How does eBPF enable a new generation of cloud native tools?
1. What are those tools?
1. What can we do with eBPF in the cloud today and tomorrow?

Even if you’re not a Linux kernel aficionado you’ll leave this talk with an understanding of how eBPF enables high-performance tools that will help you connect, manage and secure applications in the cloud.

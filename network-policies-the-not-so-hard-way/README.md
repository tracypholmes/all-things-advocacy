# Hands-on Workshop: Network Policies - The Not-So-Hard Way (with Raymond de Jong)

## Abstract

Many people avoid networking wherever possible because they think it is too complex and donâ€™t even get them started on policy. In this session, we will help overcome these fears for both app developers and operations teams with network policies the not so hard way. In four easy steps we will:

1. Introduce the fundamentals of Cilium Network Policies and the basics of application-aware and Identity-based Security
1. Discuss the default-allow and default-deny approaches and visualize the corresponding ingress and egress connections
1. Use the Network Policy Editor to show how a Cilium Network Policy looks and what they do on a given Kubernetes cluster
1. Walk through examples and demonstrate how application traffic can be observed with Hubble

The audience will walk away with the ability to create network policies for their workloads so they can stop worrying and love the secure connections, and show how you can use the Network Policy Editor to apply new Cilium Network Policies for your workloads.

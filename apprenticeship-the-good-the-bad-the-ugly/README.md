# Apprenticeship: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

# I am @tracypholmes across the board.

## Abstract

Being brand new in a remote first role, it was very hard to reach out to ask questions, stop feeling "stupid", and stop feeling like a failure. This talk will focus on things apprentices can do and how their respective companies can help them.

I was one of the first two Apprentice Engineers at my company. The company is great, but my experiences with that role weren't always. 

- Background
    - Personal background
        - Technological experience
        - The move to Software Engineering
    - How I obtained my apprenticeship
        - Talk about meeting Tameika from Women In Linux through Blacks In Technology
        - Talk about seeing the position on Twitter and Tameika fussing to make me apply
        - Talk about not getting it and how was contacted 6 months later for the Apprenticeship position
- How things worked in the first six months
    - Background on the position - it was BRAND NEW
    - The company was remote first
    - Things I was expected to learn
        - Golang
        - The tool I was working on
        - AWS
    - Why that didn't really work
        - overworked teammate and way too many issues in our repo for one person,
        - mentor was on another team,
        - boss went on parental leave
- What changed after those six months
    - I was able to interview the person who would become my boss
    - We worked on a plan to get me going with Go
        - That didn't go great at first because our communication styles were diff
        - My crew at work gave me feedback on how to approach it and let him know why I felt the way I felt
        - HE LISTENED!
    - He focused on how I best learned and made sure to get me to the point where I could level up!
- My initial plan for the future and how that's going
    - My initial plan was to change teams. My brain and Go were meh, so I wanted to move to a Ruby focused team. That didn't happen.
    - Instead I moved to another group inside of our core team. That ultimately didn't work out.
    - I realized I liked speaking and teaching and so asked to be moved to our Dev Advocacy team and that's where I am now!
- So what that means for you:
    - **Companies**
        - If you decide you want to build something like an Apprenticeship program, make sure you have a solid plan. Plan for a concrete deliverable that's well scoped, and a structure put in place to achieve that goal. Checkpoints, blog posts, review process, deliverables or mini projects, and building to something that makes a difference will help.
        - Is this different than an internship? Interns are typically an investment for a short period of time with the ability to become a long-term investment. Apprentices are long-term investments that you're committing to growing their career in your organization.
        - Good onboarding is crucial.
        - Do not limit your program to only college grads or top schools. Those students that are working 2 jobs and are at your local community college are just as invested - if not more - in making better moves and getting better jobs. And they will work their arses off.
        - Not every engineer on your designated teams have the ability to teach or mentor. Make sure the managers are identifying someone suited and dedicated to growing an apprentice, and ideally remembers what it was like to be a junior developer. Your apprentice suffers if they don't trust or know the person they are paired with.
        - Be transparent about pay.
        - Be transparent about leveling.
        - As a manager, make sure your team creates a safe space where it's okay to challenge the senior members of the team on ideas and/or implementations.
    - **Apprentices**
        - Ask questions. It's hard as hell to do. I am a perfectionist by nature, but also used to just "getting things" I need to learn. However, I was not very successful with my PRs because I was MORTIFIED of the code review process. I didn't want them to find out what I ultimately did or didn't know. And I was scared of being judged.
        - If you've never been in the tech sector before (or whatever sector), make sure you network with people in that sector. I'd never worked in a startup before - so didn't think about things like equity, or negotiating for pay relevant to the sector and position. I just used past experience and didn't find out until months later (and some stuff this year!) that I was underpaid. Another coworker went through a similar experience at a different company, so this is not unique to me.
        - Understand your strengths, how you work, and how you learn. This can be difficult to do as an apprentice. For example, I'm not great with videos - that particular medium is difficult for me. I am very visual and hands-on. I also use connections and comparisons to real-life to learn things. So, having concrete deliverables or a concrete goal is very appealing to me. I am also error driven, learn best tracking down bugs, and absolutely love the break/fix aspect of learning.  When I switched to my new team, I shared a "How to Work With Me" doc.
        - Mentors are hard to find. Don't approach the first senior level person you meet at an event and ask them to be your mentor. Be patient, and find those people that appeal to you and that you understand. Meet with them a few times before you ask - they may not have the bandwidth, but may also not want to say no. It's a very hard predicament to be in.
        - FIND YOUR CREW at your place of employment. There are people I gravitated towards in the months after starting that I can absolutely call friends to this day. They aren't "yes" people. We bounce ideas off of each other, we talk about things we're going through, they are there when I feel stupid and like a failure, and we all stand up for each other. You need these allies. They will help you survive.
        - Don't beat yourself up for things you did "wrong" as an Apprentice. Have self-retrospectives on what you're learning and how much you've grown instead of what you've done wrong.
- Where you can find me!

# Adjacency and Finding Your Purpose

## Abstract

Adjacency is not an easy pill to swallow...until you realize that pill makes you feel better/whole/complete. I started in the technical support realm, and if anyone had told me where I am is where I would land? I would have not believed you. I set out to be a Software Engineer - that is not exactly where I landed. Not landing in Software Engineering weighed heavily on me and contributed to an unhealthy mindset.

This talk will explore

- fighting with myself around what I wanted
- discovering my "thing", and
- the routes I took to get to that point

# All Things Advocacy

Thanks for stopping by! This repository will host most (if not all) of the conference talks, presentations, podcasts, or _insert hand wavy gesture here_ that I've given or was a guest of. You can find my blog posts in my profile README. Note:

1. Not all of my talks are polished or perfect, but they are representative of _my_ process.
1. I swear I'm going to write more...I just need a bit more moxie to actually publish.
  
  **This and my README are absolutely [WIP], but I'll try my best to keep it regularly updated (once I determine how I would like to arrange things).**

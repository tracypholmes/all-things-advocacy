# All Things Advocacy

Thanks for stopping by! This repo will host most (if not all) of the conference talks, presentations, podcasts, or <insert hand wavy gesture here> that I've given or was a guest of.
  
  **This absolutely a [WIP], but I'll try to keep it regulary updated (once I determine how I would like to arrange things).**
